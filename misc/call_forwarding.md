To set up call forwarding on your iPhone 13 so that cellular calls that are unanswered, busy, or unreachable are automatically forwarded to a Google Voice number, follow these steps:

### Setting Up Conditional Call Forwarding on iPhone 13

1. **Open the Phone App**: Open the Phone app on your iPhone and go to the keypad.

2. **Dial Conditional Forwarding Codes**:
   - **When busy**:
     - Dial `*67*<Google Voice Number>#` and press call.
   - **When unanswered**:
     - Dial `*61*<Google Voice Number>#` and press call.
   - **When unreachable**:
     - Dial `*62*<Google Voice Number>#` and press call.

   Replace `<Google Voice Number>` with your actual Google Voice number, including the full number with the area code.

### Checking Conditional Call Forwarding Status

To ensure that call forwarding is set up correctly, you can dial specific codes to check the status for each type of forwarding:

- **Check forwarding when busy**:
  - Dial `*#67#` and press call.
- **Check forwarding when unanswered**:
  - Dial `*#61#` and press call.
- **Check forwarding when unreachable**:
  - Dial `*#62#` and press call.

### Carrier-Specific Information

If the general codes do not work, you may need to use carrier-specific codes. Here are the codes for some common carriers in the US:

#### AT&T

- When busy: `*67*<Google Voice Number>#`
- When unanswered: `*61*<Google Voice Number>#`
- When unreachable: `*62*<Google Voice Number>#`

#### Sprint

By following these steps, you can ensure that calls to your iPhone 13 that go unanswered, are busy, or are unreachable are automatically forwarded to your Google Voice number. This setup will allow you to receive voicemail and manage calls more effectively through Google Voice.
